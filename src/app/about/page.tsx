                <p>
                  {AppName} was born out of a simple frustration every student knows: constantly hitting paywalls and sign-up forms just to use a basic online tool. Whether it was compressing an image for a project, converting a file for a class assignment, or merging PDFs for research, I found myself jumping between different websites, each with its own limitations. I envisioned a single, reliable hub where all these essential utilities could live togetherâ€”beautifully designed, completely free, and with no strings attached.
